## cooler-game-of-life
This is my java implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

### Features:
- Basic Convay's Game of Life rules
- You can change game configuration (edit state transitions, state names, add more states)
- You can change cell colors

### How to play:
- Run CoolerGameOfLifeApplication class;
- Open http://localhost:9090 in your browser;
- Put some cells on the grid;
- Press "Play"

### TODO:
- Multiple game sessions instead of one
- Import / export configuration
- Save / load game state (lexicon)
- Optimize evolve method for bigger grid

- Make condition for cell transition more complex - add random and OR / AND operators

### Examples:
